##Installation

###Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

To integrate Pitaya into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```json
github "JohnLui/Pitaya"
```

Then fetch and build Pitaya:

```bash
carthage update
```

At last, add it to "Embedded Binaries" in the general panel use the "Add Other..." button. The Pitaya.framework binary file is lying in `./Carthage/Build/iOS` directory.


###Manually

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/johnlui/Pitaya.git
open .
```
then drag Pitaya.xcodeproj into your Project, that's it!

If you want to run your project on devices with Pitaya, just go to PROJECT->TARGETS->[your project name]->General->Embedded Binaries, click ï¼‹, select Pitaya.frameWork and click "Add".
